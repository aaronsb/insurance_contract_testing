## 1. Deductibles

### 1.1 In-Network

| Coverage Level | Annual Deductible |
|---|---|
| Individual | $1,500 |
| Family | $3,000 |

**Embedded deductible**: Each family member's individual deductible is capped at $1,500. No single member must satisfy more than the individual deductible before the plan begins paying, even if the family deductible has not been met.

### 1.2 Out-of-Network

| Coverage Level | Annual Deductible |
|---|---|
| Individual | $3,000 |
| Family | $6,000 |

**Non-embedded deductible**: The full family deductible must be satisfied before the plan pays for any out-of-network family member claims, unless a single member reaches $3,000.

### 1.3 Deductible Exclusions

The following services are **not subject to the deductible**:
- Preventive care (in-network only)
- Pediatric well-child visits (in-network only)
- Telehealth primary care visits (in-network only)
- Generic preventive medications (Tier 1 Rx only)

### 1.4 Cross-Accumulation

In-network and out-of-network deductibles accumulate **independently**. Payments toward one do not reduce the other.

## 10. Prior Authorization Requirements

### 10.1 Services Requiring Prior Authorization

|---|---|

| Outpatient surgery | Joint replacement, bariatric surgery, spinal fusion, cosmetic reconstruction |
| Advanced imaging | MRI, CT, PET scan (X-ray and standard ultrasound exempt) |

### 10.2 Failure to Obtain Prior Authorization

- **In-network providers**: The provider is responsible for obtaining prior authorization. If the provider fails to obtain it, the member is **held harmless** — the provider cannot balance bill the member for the penalty.
- **Out-of-network providers**: The member is responsible for obtaining prior authorization. Failure results in a **25% reduction in benefits** (i.e., plan pays 25% less than it otherwise would). This penalty does not accumulate toward the OOP max.

### 10.3 Retrospective Authorization

Emergency and urgent services may be authorized retroactively within **48 hours** of the service or next business day. After 48 hours, the claim is subject to standard prior authorization penalties.

## Appendix A: Network Quirks & Fine Print

### A.1 Lab Work Trap

In-network physicians may send lab work to **out-of-network laboratories**. The member is responsible for verifying the lab's network status. If the lab is out-of-network, out-of-network cost sharing applies. Green Cross maintains a list of preferred labs at greencross.example.com/labs.

### A.2 Anesthesia Billing

Anesthesiologists at in-network surgical facilities may be out-of-network. Under the No Surprises Act, emergency and certain non-emergency scenarios are protected. However, for **elective procedures where the member was given advance notice and consented to out-of-network care**, balance billing protections may not apply.

### A.3 Facility vs. Professional Claims

Hospital-based outpatient services generate **two claims**: a facility fee and a professional fee. Each is subject to separate cost sharing. A single outpatient MRI may result in a facility fee (coinsurance) + a radiologist reading fee (coinsurance), both applied independently to the deductible.

### A.4 Observation vs. Inpatient Status

If a hospital places the member under **observation status** (outpatient), inpatient benefits do not apply. The member is responsible for outpatient cost sharing, which may exceed inpatient cost sharing for extended stays. The ER copay is **not** waived for observation stays.

### A.5 Preventive-to-Diagnostic Reclassification

A screening colonoscopy that results in polyp removal may be reclassified as a **diagnostic procedure**. The preventive benefit ($0) applies only to the screening component. The polyp removal is subject to the deductible and coinsurance. This reclassification occurs at the claim level based on procedure codes, not at the time of service.

### A.6 Telehealth Originating Site Restriction

Telehealth benefits apply only when the member is located in a state where the rendering provider is licensed. Services received while traveling in a state where the provider is not licensed are not covered, even if the provider is in-network in the member's home state.

### A.7 Out-of-Network Emergency Follow-Up

Emergency services at out-of-network facilities are covered at in-network rates. However, **follow-up care** (e.g., a follow-up visit at the same out-of-network facility 5 days later) is subject to out-of-network cost sharing. The prudent layperson standard applies only to the initial emergency evaluation and stabilization.

### A.8 Non-Formulary Drug Override Timeline

If a medication is removed from the formulary mid-plan-year, members currently taking the medication are given a **90-day transition supply** at the prior cost-sharing tier. After 90 days, the member must transition to a formulary alternative or pay full out-of-pocket cost.
